# Training features and the workbench

[← Back to the README](../README.md)

Everything on this page works on every model unless it says otherwise: [Klein 9B](KLEIN.md), [Krea 2](KREA2.md), [MiniMax H3](MINIMAX_H3.md) and [Qwen Image 2.1](QWEN_IMAGE.md).

## The sample gallery is an instrument

- **Live likeness scoring** — pick 3 dataset photos and every sample gets a colour-coded likeness badge (ArcFace, CPU — zero training-speed cost), with a per-epoch trend chart and best-epoch highlight, live while the run goes.
- **Training Run Visualiser** — scrub the run epoch by epoch in the browser, Royale-style, with share-ready WebM/PNG export.
- **Every epoch checkpoint carries its own preview as the thumbnail**, so file browsers and LoRA managers show what each epoch looks like.
- A **live sample override** in the status bar changes the preview prompt, seed, size or reference mid-run, no restart. The status bar itself carries VRAM/RAM gauges with per-run peak markers.

## Dataset prep

- **AI captioning with Krea 2's Qwen3-VL-4B** — every model's captions, on the Captions tab and in auto-recaption, come from it. It writes viewpoint-aware training captions in five editable preset styles (including **Style**, which describes everything *except* the look so your trigger word binds to it). Every preset's instruction is editable in plain English and persists. Florence-2 is the zero-setup option. **Bilingual captions** (English + Chinese via Helsinki-NLP) act as text-level augmentation — measurably better skin detail on Klein at identical loss.
- **Image Prep** — batch resize, PNG conversion, InsightFace face-crops with gender targeting. Pairing a tight crop with a full shot adds a lot to a character dataset.
- **Look Consistency Filter** — pick the 3 images that best nail the look and every image is scored against them (ArcFace). Worst matches surface first; mark drifters or let Auto-Suggest flag the outliers, then move them out in one click — nothing is deleted, and the scores feed the trainer's [look-outlier warm-up](KREA2.md#the-trainer-curates-your-dataset-while-it-trains-experimental).

## Output folders

The LoRA output folder lives on the Training tab's Output section and is remembered per model: switch models and each gets its own folder back. The default is `output_loras` inside Fizgig.

## Compatibility

Loads kohya, PEFT, OneTrainer (OMI + legacy), AI-Toolkit, and LyCORIS (LoKR / LoHa) — auto-converted, and LoKR/LoHa run natively everywhere: Repair Studio, Profiler, Extract, Context LoRA. Repair Studio and Explorer save LoKR as LoKR, losslessly. Output is `.safetensors` that drops straight into ComfyUI.

## The workbench

Each tool works on a trained run's output **or any LoRA you've downloaded** — and they hand off to each other (profile → repair → explore → compare, one closed loop). MiniMax H3 previews render a short clip, judged by its middle frame — the model's native regime.

### Repair Studio

A live slider per transformer block (32 on Klein, up to 50 + the token refiners on MiniMax H3) with a side-by-side preview that updates as you drag. **Turbo Preview** caches per-block activations so late-block edits redraw up to 97% faster; the baked save is always exact. Blend blocks from a second **donor** LoRA, balance the pair per block, condition previews on a reference photo, and save a `.safetensors` that works in ComfyUI at strength 1.0. On MiniMax H3 the previews are **clips with sound**, played side by side in the app, with a per-block library and first/last-frame conditioning — see [Repair Studio on H3](MINIMAX_H3.md#repair-studio-on-h3). Krea 2 has its own **✨Text fusion** presets — see [KREA2.md](KREA2.md#help-map-krea-2s-blocks).

### LoRA the Explorer

Evolutionary discovery: the app mutates blocks and shows four variants — pick a favourite and it becomes the new baseline. Freeze what you like, set how far composition drifts, cycle seeds — and send any baseline to Repair Studio (and back) with one click. A **load strength** box sets the strength the LoRA is meant to be used at; it carries across every handoff between Repair Studio, LoRA the Explorer and back.

### LoRA Royale

Point it at a training run and it renders **every epoch on one fixed seed**, with a crossfade slider — drag until it looks best and stop. An optional **likeness score** (ArcFace, CPU) rates each epoch against a training photo and jumps you to the best. Then make it shareable: epoch-morph clips, seed / prompt / strength **travels**, a **comparison sheet** (with/without-LoRA grid, same seed per row), all exportable as looping MP4/GIF with an optional deflicker pass. Works on any folder of LoRAs, or a single file.

### Profiler

How much rank a LoRA really uses and where its weights are, then renders with each block group switched off and scores likeness and bleed — which blocks carry the subject and which leak it. The result is a colour-coded HTML report. Repair Studio reads its sidecar automatically and shows the findings inline when you load the same LoRA. Klein's block map is in [KLEIN.md](KLEIN.md#block-map).

### Extract

Distil any Klein, Krea 2, MiniMax H3 or Qwen Image 2.1 LoRA to a lower rank — it runs weight-only SVD with no models loaded, and Klein's presets keep just the Identity, Style+Composition or Details blocks (or any blocks you pick). PEFT and LyCORIS sources supported.
