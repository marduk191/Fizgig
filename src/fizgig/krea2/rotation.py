"""Rotating-block fine-tuning for Krea 2 — full-rank updates on a consumer card.

Naive full fine-tuning of Krea 2 needs ~78 GB (bf16 weights + grads + Adam state).
This trains a *rotating slice* of the model instead: the DiT stays fp8-frozen
(~14 GB resident) and only N blocks at a time are swapped up to trainable bf16.
Over a cycle every block gets trained, but VRAM only ever holds grads and
optimizer state for the active slice.

The technique is LISA (Layerwise Importance Sampled AdamW) applied to a diffusion
DiT rather than an LLM — unproven in this setting, hence the experiment branch.

Precision: a CPU-resident bf16 **master copy** is the source of truth for every
trainable weight. Blocks activate FROM the master and write back TO it, so the
lossy fp8 copy on the GPU is only ever used for the frozen forward pass — training
never round-trips through fp8, which would quantize away exactly the small updates
we're trying to learn.

class RotationOffloader:
    """Keeps the trainable window pinned on GPU and streams every other block from CPU.

    The stock offloader keeps a contiguous PREFIX of blocks resident and swaps the suffix,
    pairing each eviction with a matching load so residency stays constant. Rotation needs
    the opposite: an arbitrary resident set (the active window) that MOVES every rotation.
    Rather than rework that pairing, this streams non-resident blocks just-in-time.

    Implements the same small interface the DiT's forward expects, so it can be dropped in
    as `dit.offloader` with no changes to model.py.

    Gradient checkpointing recomputes a block's forward *inside* its backward, so blocks are
    pulled back to the GPU on a backward PRE-hook (before the recompute) and evicted on the
    post-hook — evicting on the forward pass alone would leave the recompute with weights on
    the wrong device.
