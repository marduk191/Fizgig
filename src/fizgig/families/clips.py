"""Clips against a family's ClipSpec (description.clip_spec): probe, check, decode.

Fizgig does not PREPARE clips - Gizmo does. This module only decides whether a file is already on the family's
spec and, if it is, decodes it. Nothing here transcodes, resamples or trims: the moment a training app starts
silently fixing footage, two datasets that look identical train differently and nobody can tell why. Off-spec files
are REFUSED with the value found and what to do, because the failure they would otherwise cause is invisible - a
30 fps clip trains motion at the wrong speed and looks perfectly fine doing it.

Shared by every family whose description's `media` includes "clip"; the dataset layer and the launch checks reach it
through the description, never through a model package.
