"""Turbo Preview: the Repair Studio's activation cache for the standard-layer families.

For one render the DiT's blocks (each block-map id whose Linears sit under one ModuleList entry) are wrapped. A
render records every block's output; the next render with the same setup (LoRAs, prompt, seed, canvas, sampling)
where only sliders moved replays the outputs of the blocks that run before the earliest changed one instead of
running them. The run order is recorded, so a family whose text stack runs before its main blocks needs nothing
extra; a changed id with no single module (Krea 2's "Input and output") means a full render.

Step 1 only (both DiT calls when CFG is on): every block before the change sees the input it saw last time, so the
picture is identical to a full render; later steps run in full, their latent already carrying the change. Replaying
every step (old Klein's Turbo Preview) was measured on 4 Oct 2026 (768², one tweak, Klein / Krea 2 / Qwen Image 2.1):
the preview showed only 6-33% of the tweak's visible effect, so it is not offered.
Any failure (out of memory included) drops the cache and the render carries on without it. The workbench marks each
step (`step(i)`, from the sampler's on_step, which every driver calls before a step's DiT calls).
