    elementwise work that bounds INT8), and small on dense bf16. It costs compile time on the
    first step, and a recompile for every new latent shape a bucketed dataset presents.

    `boundary` places the gradient checkpoint relative to the compiled region (#99):
    "inside" (default) compiles the checkpoint INTO the graph — worth 1.19x per block, but
    inductor's partitioner stashes far more intermediates as tokens grow (measured >32 GB

    the checkpoint wrapper eager: recompute reruns the compiled graph, stashes stay at
    eager checkpointing's level, and the kernel-fusion win on the quantise/dequantise
    traffic survives — the high-resolution fit.

    Refused under block swap: compiled graphs assume their weights stay put, and swap moves them

    lowers the fp8 dequant to an fp8e4nv Triton kernel that only SM 8.9+ silicon has, and the
