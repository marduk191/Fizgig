"""Overbake metrics for the Repair Studio pop-out — pure numpy/cv2, no GUI, no models.

The pop-out compares two renders of the SAME seed and prompt, differing only in the LoRA
blocks — the one setting where no-reference image metrics are honest: absolute quality scores
on a single image are noise, but the DELTA across a controlled pair is signal. Everything here
is cheap CPU work (<100 ms for a 768 pair); ArcFace likeness stays in the GUI beside the
shared embedder.

The metrics target overbake's known signatures:
  * patch grid       — what reads as "JPEG blockiness" in a fried render is usually the
                       model's own patch lattice showing through, and we know the pitch:
                       16 px for Klein and Krea 2 (8x VAE x 2x2 patch), 32 px for H3
                       (16x VAE x 2x2 patch).
  * texture energy   — plastic skin is a high-frequency collapse, fried skin a spike;
                       Laplacian variance in the face box tells which way a block pushes.
  * clipping + sat   — blown highlights and oversaturation arrive before anything else
                       is visible.
