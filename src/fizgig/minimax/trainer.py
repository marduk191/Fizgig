"""MiniMax H3 — image-only training core: flow-matching loss + timestep sampling.

The heart of the trainer, isolated so it's headless-testable with the tiny model (no GPU,
no 66 GB base, no 32 B text encoder). The full LoRA/rotating-FT wiring, caching and GUI come
later; this pins the maths of one training step.

Flow / sign convention (matched to ComfyUI's comfy/ldm/minimax/model.py):
  x0 = clean latent, noise ~ N(0,1), sigma in (0,1) the noise level.
  noised = (1 - sigma)*x0 + sigma*noise            (sigma 0 = clean, 1 = pure noise)
  t = 1 - sigma                                     the "cleanness" fed to the time embedder
  the DiT's raw video_out predicts (x0 - noise)     (the reference NEGATES it to get the
                                                     sampler's velocity noise - x0)
So the training target for the model's output is `x0 - noise`.
