    Feeds the FT planner's clip activation term (ft_clip_activation_gb) and nothing else —
    _max_effective_mp stays untouched because it feeds the LoRA-side plan_vram. Same
    header-only scan and stale-stem filter as _max_effective_mp, with two differences:

    * A CLIP is identified by its cache HEADER, never by filename: a 3-dim latent key
      (`latent_{T}x{H}x{W}`) in a file with no `audio_only` key. Cache filenames strip the
      source extension, so an extension test would need the source directory listing — and
      that listing is optional here (missing dir just disables the staleness filter), which
      would silently zero the activation term and reintroduce the exact OOM it prevents.
    * VOICE items are excluded even though their placeholder latents are 3-dim and their
      video frames genuinely forward: their spatial grid is 8x8 latent, so their own
      activation cost tops out ~0.35 GB — inside the stills overhead's round-up, and
      field-proven at every tier. What the exclusion actually protects is the flat
      fragmentation MARGIN, which gates on T>1 and would tax every voice-only dataset
      ~2.4 GB for nothing. The `audio_only` header key is the guarantee.

    Heaviest = argmax of the per-item (T-1) x spatial_mp product (one step's peak belongs
    to one item; two separate maxima would re-create the trap documented above)."""

# Per-block movement limiter — a compressor on the block bus.
#
# Empirical finding (8 Aug, three runs + a block-range A/B): whichever block sits LAST in the
# trained range absorbs wildly disproportionate movement — 2-4x the median block from epoch 1,
# and still diverging 40 epochs later. Cut blocks 46-49 and blocks 43-45 inherit the exact
# same signature: the pathology is POSITIONAL, not a property of particular layers. The
# deepest trained block gets the most coherent, least-attenuated gradient (everything after
# it is frozen and decorrelates nothing), and Adam turns coherence into relentless movement.
# The visible symptom is output-adjacent over-editing: distorted eyes and other
# high-frequency damage.
#
# LR penalties and block cuts are positional patches for a positional problem — they just
# relocate the hot spot. This limiter is self-targeting: after each optimizer step, any
# block whose TOTAL RELATIVE movement (sum over its adapters of ||dW||/||W_base||, the same
# metric the offline analysis used) exceeds `cap_factor x median block` is projected back to
# the cap by scaling its up-factors. Blocks move freely until one hogs; then only that one
# is pulled back, wherever the trained range ends.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
class StepClipper:
    """Cap how far any block may move in a SINGLE optimizer step.

    Replaces the cumulative BlockLimiter that shipped in 3.5.0. That one clamped a block's
    TOTAL accumulated movement back to cap x median, which necessarily scaled down everything
    the block had legitimately learned in earlier epochs along with the overshoot — measured on
    real runs as a genuine likeness ceiling: limiter ON was visibly worse than OFF, while OFF
    corrupted. Clipping the STEP prevents the overshoot instead of undoing the history, so
    there is no quality to trade for the safety.

    Being per-step also removes the calibration problem that sank the movement governor: a
    per-epoch budget has to be scaled by dataset size, and got it wrong by 7x on a 272-step
    epoch, starving a run for 84 epochs. A step is a step on any dataset.

    Measured in MODEL space — the change this step in each block's effective delta, summed in
    quadrature across the block's modules — and cheap, because every term is a rank-sized
    product via <kron(a,b), kron(c,d)> = <a,c><b,d> and <UV, XY> = tr(U^T X Y V^T). A full
    weight matrix is never materialised. Over-cap blocks are lerped back toward their pre-step
    weights, which is exact to first order in the step size (the delta is bilinear in the
    factors, so the second-order term is negligible at real step sizes).

    Self-calibrating: the cap is a multiple of the MEDIAN block's step, so it needs no absolute
    threshold and targets whichever block is actually running hot — the caboose, wherever the
    trained range happens to end.

class AdapterRamp:
    """Hold each step at a constant FRACTION of the adapter's current size, ramping the LR up
    toward the configured ceiling as the adapter grows.

    The observation this comes from: an adapter at ||dW|| ~53, trained slowly for 92 epochs,
    took a full 2e-4 for ten epochs with no distortion at all and produced the best likeness of
    the project. A fresh adapter at ||dW|| ~3 is visibly damaged by half that. The rate was
    never the problem — the SAME step is a 9% perturbation of a mature adapter and a 150%
    perturbation of a new one. A LoRA starts at exactly zero, so the ratio of step size to
    adapter size is at its worst on step one and improves monotonically from there.

    Which means the conventional schedule is backwards for adapters. Warmup-then-decay is built
    for models that start from a sensible initialisation; here it is too hot when the adapter is
    tiny and too cold once the adapter could take it. This ramps the other way.

    Why it needs no calibration, unlike the retired movement governor: the governor servoed on
    an ABSOLUTE movement rate, which depends on dataset size, network type and model width — it
    was wrong by 7x on a 272-step epoch. `step / ||dW||` is dimensionless, so one target
    transfers across datasets, LoRA vs LoKR, and any model size.

    At equilibrium the adapter grows exponentially (d||dW||/dt = rho*||dW||) until the LR hits
    the ceiling, after which growth returns to linear. rho is therefore best read as a growth
    rate: 0.005/step doubles the adapter roughly every 140 steps."""
